## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Routing & Navigation**: 
The app uses React Router v6 to handle category-based navigation. Each category (e.g., Business, Sports) has its own route (e.g., /business, /sports) which renders the News component with the selected category.

- **Country Selection**:
A dropdown in the navbar allows users to switch between countries (e.g., India, USA, UK). Selecting a country updates the country state in the App component, which is passed down as a prop to the News component. The flag icon is dynamically fetched using FlagsAPI.

- **Fetching News**:
The News component fetches top headlines based on the selected category and country using static JSON endpoints from https://saurav.tech/NewsAPI.

- **Component Re-rendering**:
Changing either the route or the selected country causes the News component to re-fetch data and display updated articles. React's key prop ensures the component re-renders correctly on prop change.
